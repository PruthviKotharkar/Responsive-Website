            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Education is the process of facilitating learning, or the acquisition of
                knowledge, skills, values, morals, beliefs, and habits. Educational methods include teaching, training,
                storytelling, discussion and directed research. Education frequently takes place under the guidance of
                educators, however learners can also educate themselves. Education can take place in formal or informal
                settings and any experience that has a formative effect on the way one thinks, feels, or acts may be
                considered educational. The methodology of teaching is called pedagogy.

                Formal education is commonly divided formally into such stages as preschool or kindergarten, primary
                school, secondary school and then college, university, or apprenticeship.

                There are movements for education reforms, such as for improving quality and efficiency of education
                towards applicable relevance in the students' lives and efficient problem solving in modern or future
                society at large or for evidence-based education methodologies.

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Education began in prehistory, as adults trained the young in the
                knowledge and skills deemed necessary in their society. In pre-literate societies, this was achieved
                orally and through imitation. Story-telling passed knowledge, values, and skills from one generation to
                the next. As cultures began to extend their knowledge beyond skills that could be readily learned
                through imitation, formal education developed. Schools existed in Egypt at the time of the Middle
                Kingdom.
                Matteo Ricci (left) and Xu Guangqi (right) in the Chinese edition of Euclid's Elements published in 1607
                Plato founded the Academy in Athens, the first institution of higher learning in Europe. The city of
                Alexandria in Egypt, established in 330 BCE, became the successor to Athens as the intellectual cradle
                of Ancient Greece. There, the great Library of Alexandria was built in the 3rd century BCE. European
                civilizations suffered a collapse of literacy and organization following the fall of Rome in CE 476.

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">This is ISCED level 1. Primary (or elementary) education consists of
                the first four to seven years of formal, structured education. In general, primary education consists of
                six to eight years of schooling starting at the age of five to seven, although this varies between, and
                sometimes within, countries. Globally, in 2008, around 89% of children aged six to twelve were enrolled
                in primary education, and this proportion was rising. Under the Education For All programs driven by
                UNESCO, most countries have committed to achieving universal enrollment in primary education by 2015,
                and in many countries, it is compulsory. The division between primary and secondary education is
                somewhat arbitrary, but it generally occurs at about eleven or twelve years of age. Some education
                systems have separate middle schools, with the transition to the final stage of secondary education
                taking place at around the age of fifteen. Schools that provide primary education, are mostly referred
                to as primary schools or elementary schools. Primary schools are often subdivided into infant schools
                and junior schools.
